# CSI API

##Welcome to Car Generator/CSI API

##Getting Started

when on the home page, you should see "Welcome to CSI API", that means you're in the right place!

##Generating Cars

1) To generate a single car, type `generate-license-plate` after the / in the address bar url
- This will only generate a single lisence plate and have no other information
2) To generate multiple cars, or as many as you would like, type, `generate-license-plates/<number>` where <number> is any number of cars you would like to generate!
- These cars will render in JSON and have a 'status' property along with it. This will determine whether the car has arrived in the garage or departed from it

That's it! Thanks for using Car Generator/CSI API!
